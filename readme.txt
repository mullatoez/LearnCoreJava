1. Variables
2. Classes & Objects
        Class - A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
            e.g
            public Class Animal(){
            String name = "Cat";
            }
        Object - Is an instance of class. It has states & behaviours.
            e.g
            Animal animal = new Animal();
            animal.name;
            System.out.println(animal.name);
            // Cat
3. OOP Concepts
        1. Abstraction -
        Abstraction helps in displaying only the information needed and hides the unnecessary
        information. We can say that the main purpose of abstraction is data hiding. Abstraction means selecting
        data from a large number of data to show the information needed, which helps in reducing programming
        complexity and efforts.
        2. Inheritance -
        Inheritance is a method in which one object acquires/inherits another objectâ€™s properties.
        3. Polymorphism -
        It is an ability of object to behave in multiple form. The most common use of polymorphism is Java, when a
        parent class reference type of variable is used to refer to a child class object.
        4. Encapsulation -
        We can hide direct access to data by using
        private key and we can access private data by using getter and
        setter method.
4. String methods e.g isBlank
5. Java Collections i.e lists,sets, maps
